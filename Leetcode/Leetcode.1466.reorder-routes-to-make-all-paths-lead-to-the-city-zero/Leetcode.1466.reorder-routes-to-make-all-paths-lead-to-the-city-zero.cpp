 * Testcase Example:  '6\n[[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]'
 *
 * There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 roads such that there
 * is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a
 * tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in
 * one direction because they are too narrow.
 * 
 * Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [ai, bi]
 * represents a road from city ai to city bi.
 * 
 * This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many
 * people want to travel to this city.
 * 
 * Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit
 * the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.
 * 
 * It's guaranteed that each city can reach city 0 after reorder.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node
 * can reach the node 0 (capital).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node
 * can reach the node 0 (capital).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * connections.length == n - 1
 * connections[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
 * ai != bi
