 * Testcase Example:  '"abaca"\n[[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]'
 *
 * There is a directed graph of n colored nodes and m edges. The nodes are
 * numbered from 0 to n - 1.
 * 
 * You are given a string colors where colors[i] is a lowercase English letter
 * representing the color of the i^th node in this graph (0-indexed). You are
 * also given a 2D array edges where edges[j] = [aj, bj] indicates that there
 * is a directed edge from node aj to node bj.
 * 
 * A valid path in the graph is a sequence of nodes x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... -> xk
 * such that there is a directed edge from xi to xi+1 for every 1 <= i < k. The
 * color value of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the most
 * frequently occurring color along that path.
 * 
 * Return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or -1
 * if the graph contains a cycle.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a"
 * (red in the above image).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == colors.length
 * m == edges.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * 0 <= m <= 10^5
 * colors consists of lowercase English letters.
 * 0 <= aj, bjÂ < n
