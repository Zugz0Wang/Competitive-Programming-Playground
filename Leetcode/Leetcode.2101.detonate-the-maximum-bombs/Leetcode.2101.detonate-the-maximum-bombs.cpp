 *
 * You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area
 * where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the
 * center as the location of the bomb.
 * 
 * The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where
 * bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]. xi and yi denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate
 * of the location of the i^th bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its
 * range.
 * 
 * You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will
 * detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate
 * the bombs that lie in their ranges.
 * 
 * Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be
 * detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
 * If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
 * But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
 * So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum
 * number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
 * - Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb
 * 0.
 * - Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.
 * - Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.
 * Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= bombs.lengthÂ <= 100
 * bombs[i].length == 3
 * 1 <= xi, yi, ri <= 10^5
 * 
 *
